# KNNImputer in Scikit-Learn to Handle Missing Data 

KNNimputer is a scikit-learn class used to fill out or predict the missing values in a dataset. It is a more useful method that works on the basic approach of the KNN algorithm rather than the naive approach of filling all the values with the mean or the median. In this approach, we specify a distance from the missing values which is also known as the K parameter. The missing value will be predicted about the mean of the neighbors.
