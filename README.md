# Feature Selection Techniques in Machine Learning 

Feature Selection is the process of choosing the most important input variables (features) from your dataset that actually contribute to predicting the target. It removes unnecessary, irrelevant, or noisy features.

Think of it like cleaning your room — removing useless items makes it easier to find what you need.
Similarly, removing useless features makes your ML model faster, simpler, and more accurate.


# Need of Feature Selection
Feature selection methods are essential in data science and machine learning for several key reasons:

* Improved Accuracy: Focusing only on the most relevant features enables models to learn more effectively often resulting in higher predictive accuracy.
* Faster Training: With fewer features to process, models train more quickly and require less computational power hence saving time.
* Greater Interpretability: Reducing the number of features makes it easier to understand, analyze and explain how a model makes its decisions which is helpful for debugging and transparency.
* Avoiding the Curse of Dimensionality: Limiting feature count prevents models from being overwhelmed in high-dimensional spaces which helps in maintain performance and reliable results.
